# kubernetes-scheduler-extension

Scheduler extension for version 1.21 of Kubernetes adding thermal awareness. Based in part on examples due to https://github.com/everpeace/k8s-scheduler-extender-example and https://github.com/akanso/extending-kube-scheduler, both of whom developed extension examples that augment the normal Kubernetes documentation for older Kubernets versions.
